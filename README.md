# shellsweeper
* in progress, applying a little singleton/sized vectors, comonads/representable vectors, mtl eDSL design, lenses, and brick

## Goals
* multi-mine or traditional single-mine
* different "adjacency" conditions
* different shaped boards (must be representative functor, have a Hashable index)
* different "marking" schemes (mark with different colors and numbers)
